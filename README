DESCRIPTION: 

A post-download script to process videos and/or music downloaded with Transmission (running as a daemon) on Linux.

If video, the script calls HandbrakeCLI to convert the video to mp4  (mostly for use on a Roku).

After move/conversion the original transmission download is deleted and removed from the queue.

INSTALLATION:

Assuming Transmission Daemon is installed and configured:

mkdir /var/lib/transmission/bin

cp [scirpt files] /var/lib/transmission/bin/

edit /var/lib/transmission/.config/transmission/settings.json 
set the following 2 lines:

	"script-torrent-done-enabled": true,
	"script-torrent-done-filename": "/var/lib/transmission/bin/convert",

edit /var/lib/transmission/bin/convert
	* Set the email addresses the script should send notices to
	* Set the MEDIADIR variable -- where you want the converted videos/music to be moved to.
		* ensure directory structure already exists
